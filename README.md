# CapstoneProject

This is a copy of the code from my senior capstone project. Because it depends on services that our client uses, some of its features will no longer function.

## Login Technology
This application relies on a backend database hosted in Microsoft Azure. The authentication for accessing that database is handled through the use of azure active directory.
Upon login the user will be redirected to a webpage that will require the user to login with their Microsoft Azure credentials. If they are a valid user, then a SQL connection will be established.
